# Starting Projects
## A small showcase of what I can do when I put everything together

This repository is home to some small projects that I am working on to flesh out my portfolio a little bit while I work on my Python Roadmap alongside it

>### Projects in this repo:
>- [App Store Analysis](https://github.com/willspencer171/starting_projects/tree/master/App%20Store%20Analysis)
>   - A small-scale investigation into App store trends, using various resources to speed up processing and analysis of datasets with just shy of of 18000 pieces of data

This will get updated as and when I start more projects, and whilst I work on said projects
