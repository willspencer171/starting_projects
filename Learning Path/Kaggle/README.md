# Kaggle

Kaggle is a platform created by and for data scientists that hosts datasets as well as codebases. On top of this, it's useful that they have a series of free courses that help with getting to grips with data science as a concept. The first two series that I have undertaken are the `pandas` and Seaborn (data visualisation) courses. I have written notes about both of them in their respective python files, and split each into sections. Neither are particularly difficult but they show the fundamentals of their fields well enough - I can now use `pandas` to manage datasets and to some extent I can use Seaborn to graphically represent my data.

I felt I needed a course in data science to cover these two topics to help out with my other projects, particularly the [Analyse My Finances](https://github.com/willspencer171/starting_projects/tree/master/Analyse%20My%20Finances) project where I do exactly what it says on the tin. It's supposed to help me with managing my spending habits, identifying where I'm spending most of my money, and where I can aim to improve both my data management skills and my financial growth.

## `pandas` (completed 01/26/24)

`pandas` is a powerful and essential tool for any Python data analyst hoping to make sense of their data. It can be used not just for accessing your dataset, but manipulating it and gaining insight from your data. You can group and sort your data so that it can be used in other areas of a package, or it can clean your data and ensure consistency over your dataset. Wonderful tool really

In the notes, I show a few simple things you can do with `pandas`, as well as some more advanced things (that I really ought to look into further) like `Grouper`s

## `Seaborn` (completed 02/02/24)

`Seaborn` is a package designed to make `matplotlib` and `plotly` more accessible (since they can be a little scary to start with). It's user-friendly codebase doesn't allow for a huge amount of customisation or optimisation and (since it's backed by `matplotlib`) it can be relatively slow when dealing with a large dataset or intensive plot like a swarmplot.

What I've learned from this is that there are so many ways of representing data - you can represent relationships between data, trends in data, and distributions of data (feels like the tip of the iceberg).
